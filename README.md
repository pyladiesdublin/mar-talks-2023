# Talks
## TALK 1: No Meetup API? No Problem.
Presenting automations and new features for the Meetup app without having to use the official (costly) API. The talk will focus on the specific use case of organising events for a local, in-person tabletop gaming community (confirming attendance, booking tables, asking for anonymous feedback, communication via Discord, no-show management etc.)
